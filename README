This project was done just to expand the usability of creating customized UIButton 
images using UIGlassButton class that is no longer used.

I expanded it and made a GUI for the code. I am also adding a TabBar creator. 
I plan on using it for my Mac Applications to add a TabBar. It can be used 
however you like. It is only designed to run in the simulator because it saves 
the image to the Desktop directory. You must type in the user name used on the 
computer for the image to be saved there.

This Project works on 5.0 and below and I plan on updating it.
